= Vaccination

Vaccination is a method of controlling the spread of infectious diseases.

== Herd Immunity

Herd immunity occurs when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through previous infections or vaccination, thereby providing a measure of protection for individuals who are not immune.

The threshold for herd immunity is often calculated as:

$ p_c = 1 - frac(1, R_0) $

where $p_c$ is the critical proportion of the population that needs to be immune.
