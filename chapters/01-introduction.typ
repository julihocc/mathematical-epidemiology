= Introduction

Mathematical epidemiology is the study of infectious diseases using mathematical models. These models help us understand how diseases spread, predict future outbreaks, and evaluate strategies for control.

== Why Mathematical Models?

Models allow us to:
- **Understand mechanisms:** How does transmission occur?
- **Predict:** What will happen next?
- **Control:** How can we stop it?

In this book, we will explore various models, starting from the basic SIR model to more complex ones. We will also take a computational approach, using the Julia programming language to simulate these models and visualize the results.
