= Extensions to the SIR Model

The basic SIR model can be extended in many ways to account for more complex disease dynamics.

== The SIS Model

Some infections, for example, those from the common cold and influenza, do not confer any long-lasting immunity. Such infections do not have a recovered state and individuals become susceptible again after recovering from the infection.

== The SEIR Model

For many important infections, there is a significant incubation period during which the individual has been infected but is not yet infectious themselves. During this period the individual is in compartment **E** (for exposed).

== Vital Dynamics

In a population with vital dynamics, new births provide more susceptible individuals to the population, sustaining an epidemic or allowing new outbreaks to occur.
